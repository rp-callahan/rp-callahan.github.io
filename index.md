      ## About Me


      I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Connecticut. My research focuses on understanding how subsurface weathering influences ecological, geomorphic, and hydrologic processes. I completed a Ph.D. and Postdoc at the University of Wyoming where I worked on a variety of projects related to subsurface weathering. I still actively work with the [Bedrock Critical Zone Network](https://criticalzone.org/bedrock) on projects stemming from my time as a graduate student and postdoc. I also comleted a one year postdoc with the [Watershed Hydrology Lab](http://mzimmer.weebly.com/) at University of California, Santa Cruz working on connections between subsurface weathering and hydrologic partitioning. For more information on my research check out my publications or reach out to me at [russell.callahan@uconn.edu](rucseell.callahan@uconn.edu) with any questions.
