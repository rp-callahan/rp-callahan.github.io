      ## About Me


      I am a Postdoctroral Researcher at the University of California Santa Cruz. 
      My research focuses on understanding how subsurface weathering influences ecological, 
      geomorphic, and hydrologic processes. Currently I am working on understanding how weathering
      influences hydrologic partitioning in the Coast Range of California with the [Watershed
      Hydrology Lab](http://mzimmer.weebly.com/) at UCSC. I also continue to collaborate with the [Bedrock Critical Zone Network](https://criticalzone.org/bedrock)
      team on projects stemming from my time as a graduate student and postdoc working on the project.
      For more information on my research check out my publications or reach out to
      me at [rucallah@ucsc.edu](rucallah@ucsc.edu) with any questions.

      ### Paper out in GRL


      Check out my [new paper](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL088322) out in
      *Geophysical Research Letters*. The paper presents a new approach for
      quantifying subsurface weathering across hillslope scales. This approach
      aggregates porosity across geophysical surveys to produce a site-wide
      perspective of subsurface weathering and has direct implications for
      understanding subsurface weathering and water storage capacity across
      landscapes.
