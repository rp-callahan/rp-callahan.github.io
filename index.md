      ## About Me


      I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of California Santa Cruz. 
      My research focuses on understanding how subsurface weathering influences ecological, 
      geomorphic, and hydrologic processes. Currently I am working on understanding how weathering
      influences hydrologic partitioning in the Coast Range of California with the [Watershed
      Hydrology Lab](http://mzimmer.weebly.com/) at UCSC. I also continue to collaborate with the [Bedrock Critical Zone Network](https://criticalzone.org/bedrock)
      team on projects stemming from my time as a graduate student and postdoc working on the project.
      For more information on my research check out my publications or reach out to
      me at [rucallah@ucsc.edu](rucallah@ucsc.edu) with any questions.
